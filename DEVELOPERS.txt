The process for cutting a release from trunk is as follows:

* Load installer project if not currently loaded.
* Build Solution, resolve any errors.
* Commit all changes to trunk.
* Tag trunk to next version number in the tags directory following the "X.Y-release" naming convention. Be sure to set the explicit revision for all externals.
* Switch to new tag, or update working copy to pull down new tag (if you have the entire repository checked out).
* Edit Installer.isl in the Installer project for the new release, replacing "trunk" with "tags\X.Y-release" (X and Y being the correct values).
* Open and build Visual Studio Solution for new release tag, including the Installer project. Run the installer to make sure it works, and run/test the installed ATT system.
* Commit new tag directory for the release (you edited the installer project).
* Back in the trunk Solution, increment the Product Version under General settings of the General Information window for the Installer project.
* Commit trunk.
