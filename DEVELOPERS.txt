The process for cutting a release from trunk is as follows:

* Load installer project if not currently loaded.
* Build Solution, resolve any errors, and test the ATT.
* Commit all changes to trunk.
* Tag trunk to next version number in the tags directory following the "X.Y-release" naming convention. Be sure to set an explicit revision for all externals.
* Switch to new tag, or update working copy to pull down new tag (if you have the entire repository checked out).
* Edit Installer.isl in the Installer project for the new release, replacing "trunk" with "tags\X.Y-release" (X and Y being the correct values).
* Open and build the Visual Studio Solution for new release tag, including the Installer project. Run the installer to make sure it works, and run/test the installed ATT system.
* Commit new tag directory for the release (you edited the installer project). The release is now ready.
* Back in the trunk Solution, increment the Product Version in the Installer project -> General Information -> General settings. 
* Build and commit trunk.
