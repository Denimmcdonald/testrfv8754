COMPILATION

1) In each of the Visual Studio project properties, add a reference path to the bin\Release folder of the ATT project.
2) Rebuild the entire Solution. Check for errors.

CONFIGURATION

The ATT is configured with XML files. Two templates are provided, att_config.xml in the ATT project and gui_config.xml
in the GUI project. Copy both of these files to the Config directory of the GUI project and edit them according
to the instructions provided therein. Once you have done this, run the GUI project. If things are configured 
correctly, the ATT should start up, initialize your PostgreSQL database, and let you import data. Use the example 
shapefiles in the ShapeFiles\Chicago directory and the example crimes in Data (need to decompress before 
importing).
