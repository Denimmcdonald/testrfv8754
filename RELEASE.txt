The process for cutting a release is as follows:

* Check out the branch from which to cut a release (e.g., "git checkout master" for releases from the master branch).
* Open ATT within Visual Studio and load the Installer project if not currently loaded.
* Within the Installer project, set the Product Version under -> General Information -> General.
* Build Solution, resolve any errors, and test the ATT by installing and running it. The installer should be at the following location:

    {att_repository}\Installer\Installer\Express\SingleImage\DiskImages\DISK1\setup.exe
  
* Commit all changes to the repository using the appropriate version in "vX.Y-release" format (e.g., "git commit -a -m "Committing release version v1.3-release.").
* Tag the release (e.g., "git tag -a v1.3-release -m "Release v1.3").
* Push the tag to GitHub (e.g., "git push origin v1.3-release").
* Check out the new tag (e.g., "git checkout v1.3-release").
* Open and build the Visual Studio Solution for new release tag, including the Installer project.
* Run the installer to make sure it works, and run/test the installed ATT system.
* If there are problems, check out master, delete the new tag, and fix the problem; otherwise, you're done!
