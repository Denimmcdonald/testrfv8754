The process for cutting a release is as follows:

* Check out the most recent version of develop and test it, fixing any errors.
* Edit README.md, adding links to the new release under the "Binary Installer" and "Compilation from Source" sections.
* Commit all changes to develop.
* Merge all changes from develop into master.
* Check out master.
* Open ATT within Visual Studio and load the Installer project if not currently loaded.
* Within the Installer project, set the Product Version under Installer -> Organize Your Setup -> General Information -> General. Follow Semantic Versioning guidelines in forming the version number:  http://semver.org/
* Build the ATT Solution, resolve any errors, and test the ATT by installing and running it. The installer should be at the following location:

    {att_repository}\Installer\Installer\Express\SingleImage\DiskImages\DISK1\setup.exe
  
* On GitHub, draft a new release with tag "vX.Y.Z" and release title "ATT release X.Y.Z", attaching the binary installer file (setup.exe) that you built above.
* Rebuild the GitHub website via Settings -> Automatic page generator. Click Load README.md, use the Tactile layout, publish the page, select the gh-pages branch, and edit the page to include "<img src="./images/att.png"/>" at the end of the header element. The updated website should appear within a few minutes.
