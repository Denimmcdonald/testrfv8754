The process for cutting a release is as follows:

* Check out the most recent version of develop and test it, correcting any errors.
* Merge all changes from develop into master.
* Check out the master.
* Open ATT within Visual Studio and load the Installer project if not currently loaded.
* Within the Installer project, set the Product Version under Installer -> Organize Your Setup -> General Information -> General. Follow Semantic Versioning guidelines in forming the version number:  http://semver.org/
* Build the ATT Solution, resolve any errors, and test the ATT by installing and running it. The installer should be at the following location:

    {att_repository}\Installer\Installer\Express\SingleImage\DiskImages\DISK1\setup.exe
  
* On GitHub, draft a new release with tag "X.Y.Z" and release title "ATT release X.Y.Z", attaching the binary installer file (setup.exe) that you built above.
