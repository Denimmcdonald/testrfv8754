The process for cutting a release is as follows:

* Check out the most recent version of develop.
* Open the ATT solution within Visual Studio and load the Installer project if not currently loaded.
* Within the Installer project, set the Product Version under Installer -> Organize Your Setup -> General Information -> General. Follow Semantic Versioning guidelines in forming the version number:  http://semver.org
* In the Application properties for the ATT project, edit the Assembly Information, updating the Assembly version and File version with the version number from the previous step. Do the same for the GUI project.
* Edit README.md, adding links to the new release under the "Binary Installer" and "Compilation from Source" sections.
* Build the ATT solution and test it, fixing any errors.
* Commit all changes to develop.
* Merge all changes from develop into master and check out master.
* Build the ATT solution, resolve any errors, and test the ATT by installing and running it. The installer should be at the following location:

    {att_repository}\Installer\Installer\Express\SingleImage\DiskImages\DISK1\setup.exe

* Merge any changes to master (e.g., fixes) back into develop and commit all branches to GitHub.
* On GitHub, draft a new release from master with tag "vX.Y.Z" and release title "ATT release X.Y.Z", attaching the binary installer file (setup.exe) that you built above.
* Rebuild the GitHub website via Settings -> Automatic page generator. Click Load README.md, use the Tactile layout, publish the page, select the gh-pages branch, and edit the page to include "<img src="./images/att.png"/>" at the end of the header element. The updated website should appear within a few minutes.
